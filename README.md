# Real-Time Weather Monitoring System

## Overview

This project is a Real-Time Weather Monitoring System built using React.js and Material-UI that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It processes and displays weather data such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and the main weather condition for specific cities. The system also provides daily weather summaries with rollups and aggregates, as well as configurable weather alerts for specific thresholds.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data:** Fetches current weather conditions such as temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather condition (e.g., Clear, Rain, Snow) from the OpenWeatherMap API for major Indian cities.

- **Daily Weather Summary:** Displays rollup and aggregates for the day, including:
  - Average temperature
  - Maximum temperature
  - Minimum temperature
  - Dominant weather condition

- **Weather Alerts:** User-configurable alert thresholds based on temperature. Alerts when the temperature exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 35Â°C) in an interval of 5 minutes, but the user has to first set the threshold and update that.

- **Responsive Design:** The UI is responsive and visually appealing, built using Material-UI components for a modern look and feel. Animations are used to enhance the user experience.

- **Visual Components:** 
  - Weather data cards showing real-time temperature, feels-like temperature, and weather condition.
  - Weather summary displaying key statistics for the day.
  - Alerts shown when weather conditions breach user-defined thresholds.
